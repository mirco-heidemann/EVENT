Efficiency analysis of prevention measures in building protection against natural hazards (EVENT). Effective building protection against natural hazards is economical and reasonable. In order to assess the monetary benefits of preventive measures, a methodology for benefit-cost calculation has been developed. This makes prevention measures measurable and the (monetary) benefits of damage prevention transparent. In addition, the benefit-cost ratio can be used to compare different prevention measures, and resources can be optimally planned and deployed.

In summary:

- Effective building protection against natural hazards is proportionate and economical
- Measurable efficiency of building protection against natural hazards: The risk reduction (benefit) of the preventive measure is put in relation to its costs
- Demonstrate the (monetary) benefit of prevention
- Benchmark: Comparability of prevention measures
- Invest available resources in a more appropriate and efficient way
- Method can be transferred to other natural hazards
